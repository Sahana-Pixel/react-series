redux - its own independnet state management library
to implement we have ract-redux bridge to use in react
in context we keep the content at cnter and whoever want can be taken from a hook
data flow is more stronger in redux then conext 
there should be structure which was not context 
changes are made in function that is reduces
directly changes cannot be done
redux is independent library 
redux toolkit can be easilty stored built in middlewares 
store-> will make ,store of global varibale type from that will take everything
reducer-> to change anyththing in store inside there are many other component store 
useSelctor-> to select va;ue in store 
useDispatch-> when u want to send value
